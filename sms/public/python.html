        <h1>Python Programming</h1>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation, which helps programmers write clear and logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected, supporting multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library that provides modules for many tasks, ranging from regular expressions to web browsers, threading, and databases. This extensive library reduces the need for writing code from scratch, significantly boosting developer productivity.</p>
        <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991. Since then, it has evolved significantly. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and garbage collection. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language. Although not backward-compatible, Python 3 is now the standard, as Python 2 was officially discontinued in 2020. The language is developed under an open-source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. The Python Software Foundation (PSF) manages its development and intellectual property rights.</p>
        <p>Today, Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is widely used in diverse fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, scientific computing, and automation. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks—such as Django and Flask for web development, and NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow for data science—makes it a versatile tool for developers. Furthermore, Python's simple syntax makes it an excellent choice for beginners learning to program, while its powerful capabilities satisfy the needs of professionals building complex systems. The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts hundreds of thousands of third-party modules, ensuring that whatever the task, there is likely a Python package available to assist.</p>
