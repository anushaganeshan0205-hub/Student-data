        <h1>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h1>
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Conceived by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML was created to allow scientists to share documents easily. It is the foundational layer of the web, assisted by technologies like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for presentation and JavaScript for dynamic behavior. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically, using a system of tags to define elements. While it originally included cues for appearance, this role has since been taken over by CSS to promote a separation of concerns.</p>
        <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. Using HTML constructs, rich content like images, videos, and interactive forms can be embedded into the rendered page. The language provides a means to create structured documents by denoting semantics for text such as headings (&lt;h1&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), lists (&lt;ul&gt;), and links (&lt;a&gt;). Elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Most tags come in pairs, like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;, surrounding the content they affect. Some, known as empty elements, like &lt;img /&gt;, stand alone. Other tags like &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; act as generic containers for grouping content, forming a nested Document Object Model (DOM) tree that browsers use to render the page.</p>
        <p>Browsers do not display the HTML tags themselves but use them to interpret and render the content. The evolution of HTML is managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). HTML5, the latest major version, introduced a wealth of new features. It brought new semantic elements like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; to better describe document structure. It also introduced powerful APIs for creating complex web applications, including native support for video and audio (&lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;), 2D graphics (&lt;canvas&gt;), and improved form controls. This expanded set of technologies allows for the creation of more powerful and interactive websites and applications that work across a wide range of devices.</p>
