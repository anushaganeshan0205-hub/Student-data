        <h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. As a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript, CSS is fundamental to web design. Its primary purpose is to enable the separation of presentation and content. While HTML provides the structure, CSS controls the visual appearance, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation improves content accessibility, offers greater flexibility and control over presentation, and simplifies website maintenance. By linking to an external `.css` file, developers can apply consistent styling across multiple pages and make site-wide visual updates by editing just one file, which dramatically reduces complexity and repetition.</p>
        <p>CSS operates by using selectors to target HTML elements and applying rules to them. These rules consist of properties and values, such as `color: blue;` or `font-size: 16px;`. The name "cascading" originates from the specified priority scheme that determines which style rule applies if more than one rule matches an element. This cascade is predictable, considering factors like selector specificity, the use of `!important`, and the order of rules. This system ensures that style conflicts are resolved consistently. The evolution of CSS has been managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with CSS3 being the current standard. Unlike previous versions, CSS3 is modular, allowing new features to be introduced incrementally.</p>
        <p>This modular approach has led to powerful modern features that have revolutionized web development. Responsive design, a critical aspect of modern websites, is achieved using media queries, which allow styles to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Advanced layout systems like Flexbox and CSS Grid have provided developers with robust tools to create complex, flexible page structures with more intuitive code. Furthermore, CSS now includes capabilities for creating animations and transitions directly in the stylesheet, reducing the need for JavaScript for many visual effects and improving performance.</p>
