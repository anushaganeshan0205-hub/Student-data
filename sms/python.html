        <h1>Python Programming</h1>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation, which helps programmers write clear and logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected, supporting multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library that provides modules for many tasks.</p>
        <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991. Since then, it has evolved significantly. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing features like list comprehensions and garbage collection. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language. Although not backward-compatible, Python 3 is now the standard, as Python 2 was officially discontinued in 2020.</p>
        <p>Today, Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is widely used in diverse fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, scientific computing, and automation. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks—such as Django and Flask for web development, and NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow for data science—makes it a versatile tool for developers. Whether you are a beginner learning to code or a professional building complex systems, Python's ease of use and powerful capabilities make it an essential language to master.</p>
